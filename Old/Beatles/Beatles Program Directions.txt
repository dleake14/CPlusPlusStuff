Notes:

  You will need to use the string operators and methods provided by C++.
  Here are a few.

    #include 
 
    // determine the number of characters in a string 
    st.size()   or    st.length()
 
    // substring search 
    poe = datastring.find("="); 
 
    // picking off a substring
    ss = st.substr(start, length);
